# Notes

#### AI images?

#### GATHERING LOGS DELETES THE MESSAGES INCORRECTLY IF BOTH ARE PRESSED -> ADD CONDITION OF IF 4TH CHAR IS S OR W (added invis space to wood so both are of the same length. hence deleting the same amount)

#### Make objects, on button run obecjts with functions

<!-- AFTER COMPLETING FEATURE ONE SORT SCSS EG VARIABLES -->

#### Location images dont load accurately

<!-- 10% chance in travelling finding u a cave. Function thats always called, has variable randomised then if statement -->

<!-- sheep chance 8, deer 4, wolf 3. Wolf chance to just take damage or kill and get wolfs blood. -->

<!-- Fix wool antler chances -->
