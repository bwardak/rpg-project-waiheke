This is my _nology project in which I have made a role-playing game using HTML, SCSS and Typescript.

### Instructions

# **Goal**
---

- You must rebuild your home and challenge the monster who has stolen your dog, should he remain alive!
- Gather wood to start making your first tools, and adventure further to collect more resources and build!

# **Health**
---

- You start with a base of 100hp, if you reach 0 health, the game ends and you lose!
- Ways to lose health include, running out of energy/hunger, wolf attacks and the final monster!
- The only way to regain health is with potions, meaning your first wolf encounter is important!

# **Energy/Hunger**
---

- Your energy and hunger drops slowly, so make sure your sleeping and eating!

# **Crafting**
---

- Crafts appear once you have enough materials!
- Possible crafts will be added here soon!

# **Cooking**
---

- The same above applies for now!

# **Cabin**
---

- Living in the woods is rough! Your home is very important. Rebuilding your cabin boosts your stats!

# **Boss fight**
---

- To fight the boss you must have discovered axes, pickaxes, weapons, beds, potions, built your cabin and have 5 iron!
